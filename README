Code dump of some libclang bindings for OCaml, using OCaml-Ctypes

generte_bindings.ml shows how to interact with the Clang bindings - used for
generating OCaml code for use in binding C code with OCaml Ctypes


Usage: ./generate_bindings -file <c file>

-cppmode enables c++ header file parsing

Only implemented enough to help me semi-automatically generate code
for binding C to OCaml using OCaml-Ctypes.

Might be cleaned up in the future.
