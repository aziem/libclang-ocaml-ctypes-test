Code dump of some libclang bindings for OCaml, using OCaml-Ctypes


test.ml shows how to interact with the Clang bindings - used for
generating OCaml code for use in binding C code with OCaml Ctypes

binaryninja.ml shows how to use a C++ header file to generate OCaml
code for binding using OCaml Ctypes


Only implemented enough to help me semi-automatically generate code
for binding C to OCaml using OCaml-Ctypes.

Might be cleaned up in the future.
